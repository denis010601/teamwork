About Us
Founded in 2021 with the initial aim of establishing a private label production line in the Eastern European beverage sector, our company experienced setbacks due to the global events of 2022. 
However, in January 2023, we underwent a thorough reassessment and successfully adapted to the changing circumstances.

Currently, our primary focus lies in the realm of parallel import-export within the FMCG (Fast-Moving Consumer Goods) category, specializing in food products, beverages, snacks, and more, primarily engaged in wholesale trade.
At our core, we embody the principles of freshness, efficiency, and excellence. Our commitment to delivering high-quality products and services is incapsuled in our moto:

Fresh. Fast. Fantastic.

Our operations extend beyond Lithuania, encompassing various European countries. We have cultivated strong partnerships and contractual agreements with reputable retail chains throughout Europe.

Import/Export
At our company, we are dedicated to providing customers with a unique value proposition: well-known and reputable products at prices lower than those offered by manufacturers or their representatives. Our primary service revolves around the sale of established brands within the FMCG category.

Brands we work with
We offer a wide range of popular products, including:

How do we work?
Operating in the wholesale sector, we cater to customers who seek to procure these renowned brands in bulk quantities. 
With a strong focus on customer satisfaction, we strive to deliver exceptional value, enabling businesses to benefit from competitive pricing without compromising on the quality and recognition associated with well-established FMCG brands.
